# daily-dashboard

A hacked version of the new tab override page extension for Google Chrome.

This chrome extension should allow you to run a custom HTML page at startup and new tab. Page loads extremely fast.
#### Long Term Goals
1. Hot keys for commonly used links
2. More robust method to add links/better UI
3. Add some pyscript calls to include some useful data or infomatics

## Build Your Dashboard
1. Use: [`html-online.com`](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect) to build your HTML file
2. Click on `Releases` on GitHub  
3. Download version `Latest Release` and unzip to some directory on your computer
3. Save the HTML file to `/daily-dashboard/` as `override.html`


## Install the Extension

1. navigate to [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/)
2. check `Developer mode`  
3. Click `Load Unpacked Extension...`  
4. Select the directory from step   
5. Uncheck `Developer mode` (I think this keeps things safer)

## NOTE

This was hacked over from [New Tab Redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect)
